# Mock Polling Application Configuration
# This application now uses mock data instead of external database services

# No external environment variables are required for development
# The application uses in-memory mock data for all functionality

# For production deployment, you may want to add:
# - Database connection strings
# - Authentication service configuration
# - External API keys (if needed)
